    Connect-Cloud -tenant Contoso -AzureADver2
    Get-Content .\UpnList.txt | Set-CloudLicense -RemoveOptions    (Select-click all entries named Skype & click OK)
2. Sync AD Connect

3. Remove attributes with this script (run from on-premises Active Directory PowerShell as administrator)
4. Repeat Step #2
5. Add Skype License Back

## Connect-Cloud

Connects to Office 365 services and/or Azure.

Connects to some or all of the Office 365/Azure services based on switches provided at runtime.

Office 365 tenant name, for example, either contoso or contoso.onmicrosoft.com must be provided with -Tenant parameter.
The -Tenant parameter is mandatory.

There is a switch to use Multi-Factor Authentication.
For Exchange Online MFA, you are required to download and use the Exchange Online Remote PowerShell Module.
To download the Exchange Online Remote PowerShell Module for multi-factor authentication ONCE, in the EAC (https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/), go to Hybrid \> Setup and click the appropriate Configure button.
When using Multi-Factor Authentication the saving of credentials is not available currently - thus each service will prompt independently for credentials.

Locally saves and encrypts to a file the username and password.
The encrypted file...can only be used on the computer and within the user's profile from which it was created, is the same .txt file for all the Office 365 services and is a separate .json file for Azure.
If a username or password becomes corrupt or is entered incorrectly, it can be deleted using -DeleteCreds.
For example, Connect-Cloud Contoso -DeleteCreds

If Azure switch is used for first time :

1. User will login as normal when prompted by Azure
2. User will be prompted to select which Azure Subscription
3. Select the subscription and click "OK"

If Azure switch is used after first time:

1. User will be prompted to pick username used previously
2. If a new username is to be used (e.g.username not found when prompted), click Cancel to be prompted to login.
3. User will be prompted to select which Azure Subscription
4. Select the subscription and click "OK"

Directories used/created during the execution of this script

1. $env:USERPROFILE\ps\
2. $env:USERPROFILE\ps\creds\

All saved credentials are saved in `$env:USERPROFILE\ps\creds\`
Transcript is started and kept in `$env:USERPROFILE\ps\<tenantspecified>`


## Connect-Exchange

## Export-AndImportUnifiedGroups

Use this script to backup, restore, export, import, and update Unified Groups,
primarily when migrating group settings between tenants.

In a 1-stage migration, you will export unified groups from a source tenant,
add the domains to the target tenant, and then import the groups with users into
the target tenant. To do this, you'll use the -Mode Import -IncludeUsers
parameters when importing into the target tenant.

In a 2-stage migration, you will export unified groups from a source tenant,
import the groups to the target tenant, synchronize the data, and then add the
domains at a later date.  Once the domains are added, you can re-run the script
with the -Mode Set parameter to import the users.

## New-HybridMailbox

Designed to create and manage users in Hybrid Office 365 environment.
On-Premises Exchange server is required.

The UserPrincipalName is created by copying the Primary SMTP Address (as created by the On-Premises Exchange Email Address Policies).
Alternatively use the -PrimarySMTPAddress parameter)
Can be run from any machine on the domain that has the module for ActiveDirectory installed.
The script will prompt once for the names of a Domain Controller, Exchange Server and the Azure AD Connect server.
The script will also prompt once for DisplayName & SamAccountName Format.
All of these prompts will only occur once per machine (per user).
Should you wish to change any/all options just run: Select-Options
The script stores & encrypts both your Exchange/AD & Office 365 password.
You should be prompted only once unless your password changes or a time-out occurs.

By default, the script creates an new Active Directory User & corresponding mailbox in Exchange Online.

You will be prompted for the OU where to place the user(s).
By default, you will be presented to choose from all OUs with the word "user" or "resource" in it.
To add additional search criteria, use:  -OUSearch "SomeOtherSearchCriteria"
You will also be prompted for which license options the user should receive.

If using the "UserToCopy" parameter, the new user will receive all the attributes (Enabled, StreetAddress, City, State, PostalCode & Group Memberships).
The script enables the option: User must change password at next logon.  Unless this switch is used: -DontForceUserToChangePasswordAtLogon

Whichever Retention Policy is set to "Default", will be the retention policy that
the Exchange Online Mailbox will receive - unless this switch is used:  -SpecifyRetentionPolicy
If -SpecifyRetentionPolicy is used, the script will prompt for which Retention Policy to assign the user(s).

** The script will also take CSV input. The minimum parameters are FirstName & LastName **
**                           See examples below                                          **

## Set-CloudLicense

This tool allows you license one, many or all of your Office 365 users with several methods. IMPORTANT THIS SCRIPT WILL ADD/REMOVE DEPENDENCIES FOR ANY OPTION SELECTED For example, if Skype for Business Cloud PBX is selected to be assigned to a user(s) then Skype for Business Online will also be assigned (if the person running the script doesn't select it.)  This is because Skype for Business Cloud PBX has a dependency on Skype for Business Online thus it will also be assigned.
 Conversely, when removing options. For example, if the person running the script selects to remove the option Skype for Business Online , then the option Skype for Business Cloud PBX would also be unassigned from the user(s).  Again, Skype for Business Cloud PBX depends on Skype for Business Online to be assigned thus the dependency would be automatically unassigned.
 While this is a feature and not a bug, it is important that the person running this script is aware. THIS SCRIPT WILL ADD/REMOVE DEPENDENCIES FOR ANY OPTION SELECTED The person running the script uses the switch(es) provided at runtime to select an action(s). The script will then present a GUI (Out-GridView) from which the person running the script will select. Depending on the switch(es), the GUI will contain Skus and/or Options - all specific to their Office 365 tenant.
 For example, if the person running the script selects the switch "Add Options", they will be presented with each Sku and its corresponding options. The person running the script can then control + click to select multiple options.
 If the person running the script wanted to apply a Sku that the end-user did not already have BUT not apply all options in that Sku, use the "Add Options" switch. "Add Sku" will add all options in that Sku.
 Template Mode wipes out any other options - other than the options the person running the script chooses. This is specific only to the Skus that contain the options chosen in Template Mode. For example, if the end-user(s) has 3 Skus: E1, E3 and E5... and the person running the script selects only the option "Skype" in the E3 Sku, E1 and E5 will remain unchanged. However, the end-user(s) that this script runs against will have only one option under the E3 Sku - Skype.
 Multiple switches can be used simultaneously.
For example, the person running the script could choose to remove a Sku, add a different Sku, then add or remove options. However, again, if only selected options are desired in a Sku that is to be newly assigned, use the "Add Options" switch (instead of "Add Sku" and "Remove Option"). When using "Add Sku", the speed of Office 365's provisioning of the Sku is not fast enough to allow the removal of options during the same command.
It is more simple to use "Add Options" anyway.
No matter which switch is used, the person running the script will be presented with a GUI(s) for any selections that need to be made.
 Further explanations of the switches are demonstrated in the EXAMPLES below.


## Switch-AddressDomain

Modifies PrimarySMTPAddress via Active Directory by changing domain from old to new.  Makes the primary address a secondary (additional) smtp address.
Optionally, changes the UPN, changes the mail attributes or clears all proxy addresses first.


## Switch-PrimarySmtp

Converts an email address to the primary smtp address when it matches a specified search criteria. Run from Exchange Management Shell.
Based on a list of users specified at runtime, this script is designed to find one email per mailbox that matches a search
criteria (like contoso.com) and convert it to the primary smtp address.
The existing primary smtp address will automatically become a secondary stmp address.
